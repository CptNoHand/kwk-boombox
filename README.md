# kwk-boombox
A youtube boombox item for QBCore. 
Original script made by SbRulez (Retired). Updated by me to work with the new QBCore.

How to Install

Add:
	["hifi"] 					 	 = {["name"] = "hifi", 			 	  	  		["label"] = "Boombox", 					["weight"] = 200, 		["type"] = "item", 		["image"] = "hifi.png", 				["unique"] = false, 	["useable"] = true, 	["shouldClose"] = true,   ["combinable"] = nil,   ["description"] = "Boombox"},

to qb-core/shared.lua under QBShared.Items.

Drag hifi.png into qb-inventory/html/images folder.

Add item to a shop of your choice and enjoy!

I am not the original author of this script. The original Author is SBRulez. I converted the script to funtion with the new version of QBCore.
